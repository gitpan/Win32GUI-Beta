Events are user-defined subroutines, called automatically while in the
Win32::GUI::Dialog() phase when certain events happen in the user interface;
for example, a Win32::GUI::Button object has an associated _Click() event,
that is executed when the user clicks the button.
The convention for associating events with object is borrowed from Visual
Basic; the rule to define an event is:

sub <objectname>_<eventname> { ... }

Where <objectname> is the object's name, given with the "-name" parameter
when creating the object, and <eventname> is the name of the event itself.
For example:

$OK = $Window->AddButton(
    -text => "OK",
    -name => "Button1",
);

sub Button1_Click {
    print "You said OK!\n";
}

Particular relevance has the value returned by this event subroutines,
because it influences the way the Dialog() routine handles the event
AFTER calling the user-defined Perl subroutine:

    1   the event is passed to the default window procedure
        for normal processing.

    0   the default window procedure is not called (usually, this will
        cancel the event).

    -1  breaks the message loop and causes Dialog() to return control
        to Perl.

Every other value is treated as 1. No explicit return value is treated
as 1; pay attention, however, that the last function you call may return 
a value of 0, and this could cause misfunctionality (if not worse) in
your program. For this reason, it's always safer to explicitly end an
event routine with a "return 1;" (or 0/-1 where required).
